Question 15
What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
impact the way variables are used?

When we say a programming language is statically typed,
it means that the data types are fixed before the code runs at 
compile-time, not during program execution.

This has a positive effect, allowing us to
detect errors before the program runs and protecting
variables from being changed from one data type to another.
