Question 10
Explain what happens if you try to use a variable before it is declared in Dart.


An error will occur, and the error message will be:

Error: Non-nullable variable 'temp' must be assigned before it can be used.

This is because we haven't initialized the variable or assigned it a value,
so its value is null. Dart has a unique feature that warns you in the compiletime
if a variable has a null value. If we want to print this variable,
we must add a question mark ("?") after defining the variable.
This mark indicates that the variable is allowed to hold a null value,
and the variable can be printed without any problems.

Here is the code to illustrate the example:

int? temp;
print(temp);
