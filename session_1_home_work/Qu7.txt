Question 7
Given this code, identify any errors and explain why they occur: ```dart void main()
{ String name = "Alice"; name = 123; print(name); } ```


The error occurs in the variable "name" which was assigned a
value of type integer, while this variable is of type string.

The variable was defined as a string, which is now locked in memory
and cannot be changed once its data type has been defined.
