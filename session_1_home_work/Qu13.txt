Question 13
What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void
main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```

The result is 11.
The reason for this is what is called the order of operations.
In this case, multiplication takes precedence and is calculated first, followed by addition.
